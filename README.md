# ρ = π : Four Problems, One Constant

A unified framework connecting four Millennium Prize Problems through a single coordination ratio.

## The Central Claim

Four problems reduce to boundary conditions on ρ (the ratio of forward prediction cost to backward reconstruction cost):

| Problem | ρ Condition | Physical Meaning |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Riemann Hypothesis | ρ = π | Unitarity on critical line |
| Yang-Mills Mass Gap | ρ ≥ 2 | Minimum excitation exists |
| Navier-Stokes Regularity | ρ ≤ π | No finite-time blow-up |
| P ≠ NP | ρ > 1 | Arrow of time in computation |

The **Interval of Existence**: 2 ≤ ρ ≤ π
